# Mininet-Multicast-Demo
Implementation of centroid-based multicasting using mininet and python. Written as a final project for a Rutgers class.

## To test:
1. run final_topo.py.
2. open routers and hosts in the topology via the xterm command in the Mininet command-line.
3. run router.py on the routers and udphost.py on the hosts.
4. Type either "r" or "s" to set the hosts to receive or send.
